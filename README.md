# Th3Tunes

This is a Satisfactory mod that enables other mods to make use of the Wwise sound engine.

Currently, this mod only allows mod-added soundbanks to be found by Wwise.

## Templates

The `Templates` folder contains some textures you can use as a base for your own tapes. They are based on the "Absolute Ficsit" tape but with the branding removed.
